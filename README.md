Tiles
====

Tiles exercise by Benji Shine. (Second time, this time with Rails.)

## Overview

This is a Rails 4, Ruby 2.1.2 application that implements the tiles technical screen challenge.
To run:
    bundle install
    rails server

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Requirements

Create a board of n x m tiles on a web page.
Each tile on the board will start as white, but when clicked will toggle between a
generated random color and returning to white. Each time a tile is toggled to a
random color it should generate a new random color value.

Include a button so that users can clear (set all tiles to white) on their board.

And additionally include a save button that will persist the state of the board to a server side datastore.

## Bonus:

 * Create a gallery of all boards which are viewable and editable by any user.

## You will be judged on:

 * Simplicity of solution

 * Best practices and idioms

 * Use of a framework or sensible data/view separation

 * Code quality, abstractions, and overall architecture

 * Look, feel, and UI embellishments.
